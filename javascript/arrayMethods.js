// The arr.splice method is a swiss army knife for arrays. It can do everything: insert, remove and replace elements.

console.log(arr)

// splice method is also able to insert the elements without any removals. 
// For that we need to set deleteCount to 0
let arr = ["I", "study", "JavaScript"];

// from index 2
// delete 0
// then insert "complex" and "language"
arr.splice(2, 0, "complex", "language");

let arr = ["t", "e", "s", "t"];
